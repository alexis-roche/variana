Equation average EP

Factor approximation g(x)

AEP update: 
- set context c = g^{n-1}
- pick a factor fi
- fit fi in context c --> gi
  c fi \approx c gi
- update g:
  g^n = g^{n-1} gi --> g <- g^{1-1/n} gi^{1/n}

We can provide an alternative equivalent scheme based on the following observations.

On each iteration, the target depends on the factor under consideration: 

pi = c fi

We perform the factor fitting. The resulting target fit is:

qi = c gi

This expression also provides the context update:

g^n = qi 
==> c = qi^{1-1/n}

Hence, here is an alternative scheme in which the context is available at the beginning of each iteration. Say the context is initially uniform. 

Equivalent AEP update:
- pick a factor fi
- fit  pi = c fi with qi
- update context: c = qi^{1-1/n}

Using the Laplace method, the fitting step can be split in two steps:
1. compute the Laplace approximation gi of fi at context center
2. compute qi = c gi

Hence, the Laplace AEP update boils down to:
- pick a factor fi
- compute the Taylor expansion of log(fi) at context center --> log(gi)
- multiply: compute c <- c gi
- rescale: compute c <- c^{1-1/n}
